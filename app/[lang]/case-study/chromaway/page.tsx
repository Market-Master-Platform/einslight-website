                ChromaWay is an innovative blockchain technology company that
                grows at high speed and is nominated as one of the 33 hottest
                start-ups in Sweden. During 2018 ChromaWay faced a challenge as
                they needed to speed up their development but had limited time
                to search for and source experienced developers with very
                specific skills. After having evaluated different options, the
                ChromaWay-team have put their trust in Pangara for first a small
                pilot that quickly has grown into a team of dedicated developers
                with experience of primarily blockchain technology and AWS.

              <span className="font-bold">Einslight</span> could free up time
              that they had previously spent on recruitment. "We have had a

              personality. Through <span className="font-bold">Einslight</span>{" "}
